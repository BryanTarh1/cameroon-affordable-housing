- [x] Add regression coverage, validate crawler and responsive behavior, checkpoint the update, and provide the new project version.

## Pricing and public verification clarity review

- [x] Inspect configured AHC platform-service prices and public listing publication/verification rules, then provide an owner-facing assessment of price level and badge meaning.

## Explicit verification labels and proposed pricing model

- [x] Change public cards so non-physically-verified listings clearly say they have not yet received an on-site Field Moderator visit.
- [x] Assess the proposed 5,000 XAF verification fee, 10,000/25,000 XAF monthly plans, and 2,500 XAF seven-day featured listing price against the current model and recommend a pilot launch structure.
- [x] Add regression coverage, validate the public label, checkpoint the update, and report the completed commercial assessment.

## Unchanged-price profit model

- [x] Build a transparent monthly AHC profit model using current fees, illustrative paid-activity scenarios, direct Field Moderator payouts, payment-collection costs, and stated operating-cost assumptions before any commercial-setting change.

## Approved welcome bundle and recurring plans

- [x] Implement the approved pricing model across persisted commercial entitlements, server controls, staff settings, Agent purchase flow, fixtures, and regression coverage.

- [x] Update non-production commercial fixtures and Admin/Agent workflows without weakening the non-custodial payment boundary.
- [x] Add regression coverage, validate the commercial flows, checkpoint the pricing release, and document how the first-to-second-month transition works.

## Automated platform-service payment verification design

- [x] Design a provider-aware, webhook-led verification workflow for AHC platform-service payments that preserves Admin exception review, fraud controls, auditability, and the non-custodial tenancy boundary.
- [x] Recommend the first AHC payment-collection route and document its provider-onboarding, verification, and fallback gates before implementation.

## Secure production-data testing access

- [x] Design and, where safely possible, prepare a one-way least-privilege production-to-local testing data workflow without exposing live database credentials or permitting local writes to production.
- [x] Add and validate the token-protected sanitised snapshot endpoint, the separate local `ahc_local_test` schema, and the XAMPP command-line importer templates.
- [x] Bind the user’s XAMPP scripts folder, import the local schema, place the user-controlled token in the local configuration, and validate the first laptop pull.
- [ ] Repair the local XAMPP/MariaDB privilege-table inconsistency (`db` / `global_priv`) before creating the least-privilege local importer account.
- [x] Use the existing local XAMPP root login only as a documented temporary fallback for the isolated `ahc_local_test` importer until the local MariaDB privilege tables are fully rebuilt.
- [x] Identify and configure the active local XAMPP MySQL service port before validating the first sanitised snapshot pull.
- [x] Replace the mismatched snapshot token with one user-controlled value configured both in the protected AHC endpoint and the local private configuration file.
- [x] Verify and align the deployed snapshot endpoint’s token environment with the local importer after an HTTP 401 from the public domain.
- [x] Confirm and observe the protected snapshot endpoint’s retry cooldown after the first successful token validation generated an HTTP 429 response.
- [x] Correct the local importer configuration from the unavailable `ahc_local_sync` account to the documented temporary local-root fallback and confirm its isolated database access.

## Final local test package and comprehensive SRS

- [x] Create a 15–17 page Word Software Requirements Specification covering the full AHC platform, roles, trust rules, commercial workflow, and validated local snapshot testing setup.
- [x] Build and package a standalone XAMPP local test interface (`index.php`, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP data endpoint) that reads only the isolated `ahc_local_test.sanitized_listings` database.
- [x] Validate the local test package, assemble a safe downloadable archive, and deliver it with the Word SRS.

## Owner-only WhatsApp operational alerts
- [x] Define the owner-only high-priority WhatsApp alert events, recipient controls, message data-minimisation rules, and provider delivery requirements.
- [x] Implement a server-side event-alert framework with audit records and Admin controls for confirmed payments, verification outcomes, safety actions, and published announcements.
- [ ] Configure a WhatsApp delivery provider using protected credentials, test delivery, and document operational setup without exposing user or payment data.

## Account-entry and Admin lead clarity
- [x] Add accessible show/hide password controls wherever users enter an AHC password, without weakening masked-by-default behavior or autocomplete guidance.
- [x] Replace repeated Admin lead rows with one clear listing-level WhatsApp lead count that increases for every tracked click.
- [x] Add regression coverage and visual validation for password visibility and cumulative lead-count presentation.

## French discovery and Agent identity upgrade
- [x] Add a French-language interface option to public discovery and account-entry flows, without weakening existing English access.
- [x] Introduce image-first property quick views and a protected full-detail experience that shows media and total move-in cash before the itemised breakdown; require sign-in before revealing the map.
- [x] Extend Agent onboarding and profile records with taxpayer-number evidence and JPG government-ID front, back, and face-view uploads stored privately.
- [x] Restructure the Agent workspace into a standalone full-page experience with an Agent profile section.
- [x] Add migration, authorization, upload-format, multilingual, property-access, and responsive-interface regression coverage.

## Recovery note
- [x] Re-implement and validate the website changes from the stable checkpoint after experimental inherited edits were rolled back.

## August 2026 Agent identity and standalone-route hardening

- [x] Run the complete Vitest suite: 99 tests passing; TypeScript validation clean.
- [x] Decline a live browser upload test with real identity documents and substitute synthetic TEST-ONLY JPG fixtures.

## Safe Agent identity-upload validation
- [x] Validate the three-part Agent JPG upload using only synthetic TEST-ONLY images; never request or use real identity documents.
- [x] Confirm private storage and authorization boundaries remain intact during the synthetic upload test.

## Media-first property detail refinement
- [x] Show media and Total Move-In Cash publicly before any sign-in requirement.
- [x] Gate the itemised cost breakdown and approximate map behind the seeker sign-in completion flow.
- [x] Confirm the hash-routed Agent workspace is a separate full page with its profile section visible.
- [x] Add targeted regression coverage and validate the revised public-to-protected property flow.

## Anonymous public-home query repair
- [x] Identify and suppress the protected query issued during anonymous public-home browsing.
- [x] Preserve sign-in prompts only for explicitly protected actions, without global redirect or console-error noise.
- [x] Add regression coverage and validate an anonymous public-home session in the browser.

## Owner-only test-account credential reference
- [x] Verify the current non-production account roster and distinguish test credentials from real-user password data.
- [x] Create an owner-only Word reference covering role access, available demo credentials, and password-reset guidance.
- [x] Review and deliver the document without exposing real-user credentials.

## Complete public French translation
- [x] Audit the public marketplace, preview, sign-in prompts, and account-entry copy that currently remains English after locale switching.
- [x] Expand the locale dictionary and bind all visible public text to it.
- [x] Add locale-completeness regression coverage and validate English and French rendering in the browser.

## Reusable bilingual delivery workflow
- [x] Create and validate a reusable skill documenting the AHC full-stack marketplace and bilingual-delivery workflow.
- [x] Persist the public language selection in local storage and restore it on later visits.
- [x] Translate the standalone Agent dashboard and profile experience with the same shared locale system.
- [x] Add reduced-motion-safe language-switch transitions, Agent access-status localization, and regression coverage for persistence and Agent locale support.

## Language menu refinement
- [x] Replace each English/French toggle with an accessible language-selection dropdown while preserving persisted shared locale behavior.
- [x] Add regression coverage and validate the menu at desktop and mobile widths.

## Payment and WhatsApp provider continuation
- [x] Audit the current payment-reference, reconciliation, receipt, and provider-readiness workflow to define the next production payment increment.
- [x] Review the existing Meta WhatsApp Cloud API alert foundation, credential status, and webhook safeguards before continuing provider activation.
- [x] Implement the selected safe payment and WhatsApp provider improvements with automated regression coverage.
- [x] Validate the completed provider-ready flows and document the owner activation steps required for live delivery.

## Dual Mobile Money provider readiness
- [x] Define one secure provider contract for both MTN MoMo and Orange Money without accepting rent, deposits, or tenancy funds through AHC.
- [x] Add provider-specific payment-order metadata and validation while preserving Admin reconciliation and post-confirmation receipts.
- [x] Add dual-provider regression coverage for reference handling, duplicate prevention, reconciliation, and receipt boundaries.
- [ ] Prepare secure activation inputs for MTN MoMo, Orange Money, and Meta WhatsApp Cloud API.

## Dual-provider payment experience
- [x] Make the Agent payment journey explicitly provider-specific for MTN MoMo and Orange Money, including clear payment-reference guidance and pending-confirmation status.
- [x] Make the Admin reconciliation view show the selected Mobile Money provider and protect receipt generation until a valid confirmation decision.
- [x] Add focused UI and workflow tests for the dual-provider payment experience and validate the signed-out workspace presentation.

## Merchant onboarding prerequisite
- [x] Create an owner-run guide that separates AHC’s provider-independent payment controls from MTN and Orange merchant onboarding.
- [ ] Complete MTN MoMo and Orange Money business/merchant onboarding before supplying protected credentials for live collection and provider callbacks.

## Shortlist, viewings, and Moderator routes
- [x] Add a seeker-owned saved shortlist with a privacy-safe side-by-side property comparison limited to public and seeker-authorized details.
- [x] Add agent-managed viewing slots with explicit seeker request, agent confirmation/decline, cancellation, and stale-slot safeguards.
- [x] Add a Moderator-only route planner that groups eligible verification work by approximate public landmark zones without exposing exact compounds.
- [x] Add schema migrations, protected tRPC procedures, focused Vitest coverage, and responsive visual validation for all three workflows.

## Ten-feature marketplace enhancement programme
- [x] Reconcile the original ten proposed marketplace improvements against the preserved project history and confirm the four items not named in the current feature summary before implementation.
- [x] Add a signed-in seeker budget-fit calculator that clearly distinguishes illustrative affordability guidance from lending, financial, or tenancy approval.
- [x] Add a 48-hour viewing-request availability-reconfirmation safeguard with privacy-safe state transitions and accountable Agent action.
- [x] Add immutable, seeker-visible price-history and material-change disclosures that do not expose private internal audit evidence.
- [x] Add a server-side duplicate-listing risk detector and protected staff review workflow without automatic punitive action on uncertain matches.
- [x] Add a structured post-viewing outcome flow for authenticated seekers without public ratings, testimonials, or fabricated reviews.
- [x] Add an Agent quality dashboard based only on verifiable platform events, with no fabricated ratings, reviews, or response claims.
- [x] Add a low-data marketplace mode that preserves core price, freshness, and safety information on constrained mobile connections.
- [x] Add migrations, role-authorized procedures, focused Vitest coverage, and responsive validation across all seven remaining features.
- [x] Publish this checkpoint and activate the project-level 48-hour viewing-availability expiry schedule against the deployed site.

## Seven-feature live testing walkthrough
- [x] Create a concise role-based guide that walks the owner through testing each newly released marketplace feature on the live site.

## Pre-payment stability stress validation
- [x] Audit existing regression coverage and define safe, deterministic high-volume scenarios for public discovery, protected workflows, role boundaries, and appointment state transitions.
- [x] Add scale-oriented regression coverage that does not insert, alter, or disclose live customer data.
- [x] Run comprehensive TypeScript, unit, integration, authorization, database, and controlled concurrency validation; investigate every reproducible failure.
- [x] Review desktop/mobile routes and current runtime logs for interface or server regressions.
- [x] Fix verified defects, add regression protection, rerun validation, and save a final stable checkpoint before any payment expansion.

## Customer dashboard and payment-experience feedback
- [x] Add a protected customer dashboard route with a clear account overview and safe navigation back to the marketplace.
- [x] Add customer-owned profile viewing and editing without exposing protected Agent, Moderator, or Admin identity data.
- [x] Add customer-owned platform-service order tracking with status, provider, amount, and receipt access only for that customer’s records.
- [x] Add accessible pending, success, and actionable error feedback to existing and upcoming platform-service payment actions without collecting rent, deposits, or other tenancy funds.
- [x] Add role-authorized procedures, focused Vitest coverage, and responsive UI validation for dashboard and payment-experience workflows.
- [x] Correct the authenticated dashboard-load error state so a service failure is never misrepresented as a sign-in requirement.

## Customer dashboard personalisation and checkout feedback
- [x] Add customer-owned favourite listings and a private recent-browsing history with protected listing references.
- [x] Add a safe customer profile-picture upload that accepts only small image files, stores only an object reference, and never exposes another account’s image-management controls.
- [x] Add customer-managed email-notification preferences without sending or implying real email delivery until an email provider is separately configured.
- [x] Add a clearly labelled test-only checkout simulator that exercises loading, success, retry, and error feedback without charging any payment method or creating a real platform-service order.
- [x] Add schema migration, ownership tests, storage validation, and desktop/mobile regression coverage for the new dashboard extensions. TypeScript and 146 tests pass; signed-out desktop and mobile dashboard captures confirm the protected route’s responsive access boundary.

## Global protected-route hardening
- [x] Prevent direct hash-path changes from rendering any unauthorized Agent, Moderator, Admin, or customer workspace content; enforce role-appropriate redirects while retaining server-side authorization as the security boundary.
- [x] Add route-access regression coverage for signed-out and wrong-role deep links, validate the protected-route layouts, and publish the safe workspace links. Desktop and mobile visual checks: anonymous deep links to Admin, Operations, route batches, Agent, customer dashboard, and acceptance each returned to the public marketplace without rendering a protected workspace. Full suite: 148 tests pass; production build succeeds.

## Standard browser URL migration
- [x] Replace hash-based AHC navigation with standard browser paths, preserve legacy hash links through safe migration redirects, and retain protected-route role enforcement on direct visits and refreshes.
- [x] Update route, navigation, deep-link, and responsive regression coverage; validate standard URLs at desktop and mobile sizes; checkpoint and deliver the normal-looking production links. TypeScript, 150 tests, and production build pass; desktop/mobile checks confirm normal direct paths and former hash links safely land at permitted pages without rendering protected content.

## Clean-link authorization security review
- [x] Conduct a controlled, non-destructive audit of anonymous, cross-role, legacy-link, direct-request, and object-ownership authorization boundaries for the new browser-path routes.
- [x] Remediate any verified authorization bypasses, add regression coverage, validate the fixes, and checkpoint the security review. The audit found and closed a private-storage proxy bypass, and it added server-side Agent API role enforcement. Anonymous clean-path checks redirect safely; TypeScript, 157 tests, and the production build pass.

## Profile-picture removal
- [x] Allow a customer to remove their profile picture and restore a blank/default avatar state without affecting another account.
- [x] Add ownership and UI regression coverage for avatar removal, then validate and checkpoint the change. Focused and full validation pass: 160 tests and the production build succeed. Signed-out desktop/mobile dashboard checks preserve the protected-route redirect; authenticated blank-avatar behavior is covered by dashboard UI and ownership regressions.

## Trust-first marketplace upgrade
- [x] Preserve clearly labelled test listings until real listing status, evidence, freshness, and moderation workflows are live-tested. Current fixture inventory keeps the stored TEST DATA title prefix, shows a protected-detail disclosure, and has focused regression plus desktop/mobile verification.
- [x] Improve the protected property-details experience with complete, data-backed listing information and a clear viewing-request action.
- [x] Add reliable discovery filters for property type, bedrooms, furnished status, monthly rent, Total Move-In Cash, availability, verified status, and neighbourhood.
- [x] Strengthen report reasons and moderation review without automatic punishment based solely on report volume.
- [x] Standardise the viewing-request lifecycle around Requested, Agent responded, Viewing scheduled, Viewing completed, and Cancelled, with safe meeting and reminder information.
- [x] Consolidate renter dashboard tools, add objective agent trust signals, and introduce stored saved-search alerts without implying unconfigured email or WhatsApp delivery.
- [x] Add ownership, authorization, desktop/mobile, and regression validation for the marketplace upgrade, then checkpoint it. Desktop and mobile verification: expanded public discovery filters render correctly, and anonymous access to `/dashboard` safely returns to public content. Authenticated renter-dashboard behavior is covered by UI and ownership regressions. Full TypeScript/build validation and 163 tests pass.

- [x] Add a persisted furnished-status field and reliable public discovery filter so the trust-first discovery checklist is complete without inferring listing details.

## Media-first public discovery refinement
- [x] Make verified walkthrough videos and listing imagery the dominant public browsing surface while retaining a continuously prominent Total Move-In Cash figure.
- [x] Add responsive and regression validation for the media-first listing experience, then checkpoint the refinement. Full suite: 165 tests pass; production build and desktop/mobile visual reviews pass.

## Developer-tools reference guide
- [x] Create a Word guide that classifies the developer and operational tools shared by the owner, explains safe step-by-step use, and prioritises their relevance to Affordable Housing Cameroon.

## Independent continuation handover
- [x] Document how the owner can continue developing, hosting, securing, and operating AHC outside Manus, including the required replacements for managed services and scheduled jobs.

## Search-result loading state
- [x] Add an accessible, responsive, reduced-motion-safe loading skeleton for public property search results and verify it through regression and responsive review. Full suite: 168 tests pass; production build and desktop/mobile visual reviews pass.

## Agent and Moderator access repair
- [x] Diagnose why the reported browser cannot sign in to Agent and Field Moderator workspaces, distinguishing credentials, provisioning, route guards, and session/runtime errors. Cause confirmed: the global protected-route guard redirected signed-out visitors before the existing role-specific AHC sign-in forms could render.
- [x] Repair any verified access defect, add focused regression coverage, validate both role entry paths, and checkpoint the fix. Anonymous Agent, Field Moderator, Field Moderator route-board, and Admin paths now expose only their secure sign-in boundary; wrong-role protection and server-side authorization remain enforced. Full suite: 170 tests pass; production build and desktop/mobile checks pass.

## Property sharing, neighbourhood privacy, and card trust signals
- [x] Add crawler-visible, property-specific OpenGraph sharing metadata with an approved generated share card, landmark location, and Total Move-In Cash, without exposing private information. The server metadata includes only persisted property type, physical-verification state, declared supply capacity, approximate landmark, and price; it does not publish the compound door, contacts, proof, or an exact address.
- [x] Verify and enforce 200–500 m landmark-radius map pinning so exact compound locations remain private until a viewing is scheduled. The shared helper clamps the stored radius and moves the public point away from the submitted reference; the public map now labels the same bilingual radius boundary and displays the persisted privacy radius.
- [x] Strengthen the public listing-card presentation of objective ownership type and freshness information, with focused regression, desktop/mobile, and crawler-metadata validation. Cards now render the persisted direct-owner or managing-agent declaration and an emphasized reconfirmation signal; 176 tests, a production build, desktop/mobile review, and a WhatsApp-style live crawler response check pass.

## Seeker acquisition, ethical demand metrics, and privacy guidance
- [x] Produce an in-depth owner guide for increasing voluntary seeker sign-ups, translating aggregate demand signals into ethical platform revenue, and applying privacy-by-design safeguards to seeker accounts. The guide includes voluntary activation prompts, a decision-ready funnel, minimum-cohort aggregate demand reporting, ethical supply-side revenue models, a 90-day operating plan, and Cameroon Law No. 2024/017 research with a local-counsel review recommendation.

## Marketplace workflow feasibility review
- [x] Audit the existing Zillow-inspired Total Move-In Cash, Leaflet landmark-map, and cost-breakdown presentation; implement only any verified usability gap. The total and protected breakdown were already truthful; each approximate landmark pin now has a compact public Total Move-In Cash label without adding any door-level location data.
- [x] Audit the existing Field Moderator evidence, verification, and freshness lifecycle; implement only any verified data-backed verification-status gap without exposing proof publicly. Private proof, two-photo and walk-through requirements were already present; public physical badges now resolve to unverified when the saved verification period has expired.
- [x] Assess the requested three-report automatic safety hold against AHC’s human-review and anti-abuse requirements; implement a safe evidence queue alternative only if a real gap exists. Three distinct cost or availability reports now create a private priority-review signal with account-age and network-pattern context; report volume alone cannot suspend a listing, erase a badge, or restrict an Agent.
- [x] Audit the tracked WhatsApp lead flow and Admin lead measurement; implement only any verified authorization, tracking, or user-experience gap. The existing protected hand-off logs an authenticated lead before producing the pre-filled WhatsApp link, and only Admins can read lead counts; focused authorization and count regressions pass.

## Safety-report review status notifications
- [x] Add a protected, reporter-owned in-app status update after an Admin completes a safety-report review, revealing only the report’s own reviewed state and a privacy-safe outcome message. Admin completion is auditable and creates one owner-scoped update; the dashboard notices disclose no staff notes, proof, other reports, sanctions, or enforcement rationale.
- [x] Add ownership, role, and information-disclosure regressions; validate the reporter account experience at desktop and mobile sizes. The release adds protected reviewer and reader tests, full test/build validation, and desktop/mobile checks of the anonymous account-route boundary.
- [x] Repair the discovered `/account` protected-dashboard route regression so reporter-owned review updates remain reachable through the documented clean URL. `/account` now uses the same role-aware CustomerDashboard guard as `/dashboard`, and anonymous visitors safely return to the marketplace instead of receiving a 404.

## Complete bilingual interface coverage
- [x] Audit every public and protected page for English-only interface strings, including form labels, placeholders, help text, options, inline validation, loading states, error messages, toasts, empty states, and action controls. The audit found that page-specific dictionaries alone did not cover all legacy and staff forms.
- [x] Extend the shared locale architecture and translate all verified gaps into French while preserving values, identifiers, role boundaries, and non-translatable user content. A global AHC static-interface layer now changes only known AHC text and approved accessibility attributes, keeps an explicit no-translate boundary, and synchronises the language across routes; public Agent, Moderator, and Admin sign-in forms also receive the selected language directly.
- [x] Add locale-completeness and form-state regressions, then validate English/French desktop and mobile views across public, Agent, Moderator, Admin, and seeker account entry points. Added translator, staff-access, and Agent-form regressions; 197 tests, production build, and French desktop/mobile visual review passed.

## Public Manus reference cleanup
- [x] Audit visitor-visible pages, metadata, icons, and bundled public assets for mentions of Manus AI or Manus branding; preserve non-visible runtime configuration and the existing domain. No visitor-facing reference was present in the public client source, server-rendered preview output, document metadata, or homepage visual review.
- [x] Remove confirmed public-facing references and add regression coverage so future visitor copy does not reintroduce them. No public-facing reference required removal; runtime environment names and the existing domain remain untouched because they are not website copy or visible branding.

## Analytics geography investigation
- [x] Inspect the configured analytics script and available site traffic records to explain United States-labelled pageviews without treating location data as proof of genuine United States visitors. The repository confirms a proxy-hosted analytics integration but contains no raw event-level data; official provider documentation confirms that country is IP/proxy-derived and that recognised-bot filtering is not a proof that every automated request is absent. The resulting guidance is recorded in `docs/analytics-geography-investigation.md`.

## Login and safety-report CAPTCHA
- [x] Audit the current local sign-in and authenticated safety-report submission contracts, then select a privacy-conscious CAPTCHA provider with server-side verification. Cloudflare Turnstile was selected; the configured server secret was independently validated against Siteverify without exposing it in client code.
- [x] Add required CAPTCHA completion and server verification to each sign-in and safety-report submission path without exposing provider secrets or allowing client-only bypass. Local registration and password sign-in share an accessible Turnstile widget; authenticated safety reports require an independent token; the server fails closed when the secret is absent or validation fails.
- [x] Add disabled-provider, failed-token, expired-token, route-coverage, and protected-flow regressions; document the one-time provider credential activation step. The full suite passes with 204 tests and the production build succeeds; the provider documentation records hostname management and the preview-only `110200` recovery path.

## Production safeguards verification
- [x] Verify whether server-side move-in-cost validation, landmark-radius privacy, tracked WhatsApp lead logging, and 14-day freshness automation already meet the requested production refinements; identify only concrete gaps. Move-in totals are derived server-side from validated component values rather than accepted as an agent-provided total; public maps use one generated 200–500 m landmark point with no exact-coordinate columns; authenticated WhatsApp lead events are persisted before the 302 redirect; and an enabled daily 03:00 UTC cron archives stale published listings after 14 days. The remaining product decision is whether expiry should additionally set a physical-verification badge to unverified instead of relying on the existing archived/non-public state.

## Verified-listing preview media
- [x] Inventory the current physically verified listing media, then improve preview attention with media that is clearly distinguished from real field evidence and required moderator walk-through footage. Four published test listings are physically verified; two have published 16-second walkthroughs and the other two have no published video.
- [x] Add provenance labels and regression coverage so generated illustrative assets cannot receive a physical-verification or real-walk-through claim. The public interface now explicitly states that AHC does not substitute generated footage when a field walkthrough is unavailable, with focused regression coverage for the no-manufactured-video boundary.
- [x] Make existing moderator-captured photos and published vertical walkthroughs the primary card preview for physically verified listings; display an explicit real-evidence-only unavailable state where a verified listing has no published walkthrough. The media rail now includes existing videos and transparent unavailable cards for verified listings missing a public walkthrough; desktop/mobile checks, 205 Vitest tests, and a production build pass.
- [x] Repair public photo rendering for verified listings using only the existing genuine public photo URLs, and ensure no synthetic image or video substitute appears when authentic media is unavailable. Approved gallery photos now render as primary media where a verified listing lacks a published moderator walkthrough, and the listing detail presents the complete approved-photo set.
- [x] Create a curated public gallery model and authorize only the owner-approved, non-document private evidence from the four existing physical-verification TEST DATA records for public display with preserved test-data provenance. Eight approved photo records now have separate, auditable public-gallery entries; raw private evidence and documents remain outside public projections.
- [x] Enforce that a listing can become publicly published only after a passed physical confirmation and at least one expressly approved public photo or published moderator-captured walkthrough; cover publication, depublication, and private-evidence non-disclosure with regressions. Public discovery filters out any listing without current physical verification and approved media. The full suite passes with 208 Vitest tests and the production build succeeds.

## Admin role wording
- [x] Replace the Admin-board audience label “Seeker / Agent” with “Seeker or Agent” without changing underlying role values or authorization behavior. The selector still submits the same internal `user`, `moderator`, and `admin` values; a production build passes.
- [x] Replace the combined `user` role with distinct `seeker` and `agent` roles through a safe migration; update Admin role assignment, preserve Moderator/Admin protections, and add authorization regressions for each role. Existing accounts were mapped according to Agent-profile ownership, public registration permits only Seeker or Agent, and the Admin selector now offers Seeker, Agent, Moderator, and Admin independently. All 211 Vitest tests and the production build pass.

## Homepage copy refinement
- [x] Shorten and simplify the homepage’s high-visibility public copy while retaining required trust, privacy, pricing, freshness, and verification information in English and French. Focused bilingual disclosure regression, 213-test suite, production build, and English/French desktop plus mobile review pass.

## Budget-fit feature discoverability
- [x] Verified that the budget-fit calculator appears for signed-in seekers directly above the public Fresh Homes controls; it deliberately remains hidden until sign-in because it evaluates the seeker’s entered income and available move-in savings. No rendering or access defect was found.

## Owner WhatsApp event notifications
- [ ] Audit the existing event-alert and WhatsApp provider implementation, then define and implement privacy-safe owner alerts for approved major platform events.
- [x] Add privacy-minimised owner alerts for successful Agent, Moderator, and Admin sign-ins only; preserve the exclusion of individual Seeker sign-in alerts. The event is queued only after successful authentication and carries a non-sensitive role/reference label.

## Registration confirmation reliability
- [ ] Diagnose and repair the reported registration confirmation failure while retaining fail-closed Turnstile verification and duplicate-account protection.

## Owner email notification fallback
- [x] Add a privacy-safe email fallback for approved owner alerts while Meta WhatsApp activation is unavailable. Resend is used only when Meta WhatsApp has not completed signed delivery-webhook activation.
- [x] Implement the approved transactional-email sender, owner recipient configuration, delivery audit state, and non-blocking failure handling for owner alerts. Resend credentials and sender validation pass; a controlled email activation alert was accepted by the provider.
- [x] Isolate the live Resend credential probe from ordinary offline regressions while retaining a repeatable explicit provider-validation command. `pnpm test:resend:live` verifies configured live credentials; normal tests stay offline and deterministic.

## Pilot and launch-readiness assessment
- [x] Assess the current marketplace against pilot-launch requirements and prioritise only the next additions that materially improve safety, trust, usability, or operations. Recommendation delivered separately; no unselected feature work was committed.

## Independent project handover
- [x] Prepare a beginner-safe guide for exporting the project, backing up its data and media, recreating dependencies, and running it independently outside the current platform. The guide identifies the current storage dependency that must be replaced before independent public hosting.

## Universal public verification disclosure
- [x] Remove the redundant “Physical badges only” public control and replace it with a bilingual statement that every public home has current Field Moderator verification and approved real media. Focused regression, 218-test suite, production build, and desktop/mobile review pass.

## Language control clarity
- [x] Remove the duplicate public language control while retaining a single accessible English/French selector and full-page translation behaviour. Focused regression, 218-test suite, production build, and desktop/mobile review pass.

## Completed-project recap
- [x] Prepare a structured owner recap that distinguishes implemented platform capabilities from remaining external activation steps. Delivered as a standalone owner-facing reference document.

## Reusable advanced framework assessment
- [x] Explain how an advanced reusable local framework is used and assess whether the current marketplace should be converted into one before implementation begins. Delivered as a standalone guide; no framework code was created yet.

## Advanced reusable framework

- [x] Create a separate sanitised framework repository structure that excludes AHC production data, secrets, branding, live domains, and housing-specific rules.
- [x] Extract reusable role-based access, moderation, media-governance, owner-alert, bilingual-interface, audit, configuration, and test foundations.
- [x] Provide a documented template/example plus a repeatable new-project workflow and a packaged local-framework archive.

## Competitor-informed AHC enhancement planning

- [x] Prioritise and confirm a competitor-informed enhancement package that emphasises AHC’s current-verification, total move-in cash, media-governance, safety, and location-privacy strengths before implementation.
- [x] Refocus the next AHC package on real local adoption, trusted early supply, and a controlled pilot because the reviewed competing platforms appear to have limited practical use in the target market.

## Adoption-led Trust Passport and pilot tools

- [x] Add a public Trust Passport that presents approved evidence boundaries, physical-review recency/expiry, approved media status, and transparent total move-in cash without exposing private evidence or exact locations.
- [x] Add a guarded Safe Viewing Request workflow with privacy-safe scheduling, authorised status handling, and no premature exposure of exact property coordinates.
- [x] Add an Agent launch/onboarding progress experience that explains the required steps for an eligible public listing without weakening existing role, identity, or media requirements.
- [x] Add an owner/Admin pilot dashboard showing genuine operational counts for eligible homes, review freshness, agent submissions, safe-viewing requests, and safety reports.
- [x] Add focused automated tests plus desktop/mobile validation for the new trust, viewing, onboarding, dashboard, authorization, and privacy flows.

## Sign-in feedback and duplicate-submission prevention

- [x] Improve all AHC-supported credential sign-in forms with accessible processing feedback, disabled repeat submission, clear wrong-credential/recoverable-error guidance, and focused automated coverage.

## Seeker safe-viewing status journey

- [x] Confirm the existing privacy-safe Seeker appointment history already presents each user’s own viewing-request statuses, next steps, authorised appointment details, cancellation, and private post-viewing outcomes without premature exact-location disclosure.
- [x] Confirm the existing authenticated Seeker appointment flow enforces ownership and privacy boundaries through its established router procedures and public marketplace rendering.

## Owner pilot readiness checklist

- [x] Add an Admin-only Pilot Readiness Checklist that converts genuine pilot-summary counts into clear operational next steps without inventing launch metrics or exposing private records.
- [x] Add focused authorization, guidance-state, and responsive-flow validation for the owner Pilot Readiness Checklist.

## Owner weekly pilot activity

- [x] Add an Admin-only seven-day pilot activity summary using only genuine timestamped listing, viewing, and safety-report records without exposing people, contact details, addresses, or private evidence.
- [x] Add focused Admin-authorization, time-window, and responsive presentation validation for the weekly pilot activity summary.

## Viewing follow-through improvement

- [ ] Audit and improve the privacy-safe transition from a Seeker viewing request to a confirmed, cancelled, or completed appointment without exposing exact locations prematurely.
- [ ] Add focused ownership, status-transition, and responsive-flow validation for the approved viewing follow-through improvement.

## Media-first discovery and listing quality

- [x] Enforce a clear public-listing quality standard requiring a substantive description and at least five approved public images before publication, while preserving an approved public walkthrough as a valid alternative and retaining private-evidence boundaries. Existing approved gallery evidence remains separately curated; no private verification material is projected publicly.
- [x] Add clear public property facts for bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, and neighbourhood amenities through an additive schema migration, safe public projection, Agent entry form, and listing-detail support. The description and declared facts are labelled as Agent-declared, while field-captured area observations retain their Field Moderator provenance.
- [x] Refine the public discovery layout so media appears first, total move-in cash follows immediately beneath it, and the search entry is compact with optional filters revealed only on request.
- [x] Add privacy-safe relevant-property suggestions based only on the current public listing/search context. Ranking considers city, property type, bedroom count, displayed rent band, and optional area wording; it never reads saved items, viewer history, contacts, private evidence, or exact coordinates.
- [x] Add focused tests and responsive validation for listing quality, property facts, compact search, media-first hierarchy, and relevant-property suggestions. Full regression and build validation pass with 232 tests, 1 intentional live-provider skip, plus desktop and mobile marketplace review.

## Public inventory correction after media-quality rollout

- [x] Audit and correct the unexpectedly low visible public-home count without relaxing the verified-media standard. The compact search no longer defaults to a 300,000 XAF ceiling, so it now presents both currently eligible walkthrough-backed TEST DATA homes; the default remains adjustable by the viewer.
- [x] Verify visible inventory count, recommendation availability, regression safeguards, and responsive marketplace presentation. The full suite passes with 233 tests and one intentional live-provider skip; the production build and desktop marketplace review confirm both eligible homes are visible.
- [ ] Add new owner-authorized, genuine Field Moderator-captured photos or published walkthroughs for the remaining clearly labelled TEST DATA listings before they can return to public discovery. Existing evidence supplies only two or three distinct non-document photos per excluded listing; it must not be duplicated, invented, or represented as verified property media.
- [ ] Receive and match owner-authorized genuine property-photo sets to each excluded TEST DATA listing, then curate only suitable non-document media through the existing Field Moderator approval boundary.

## Labelled illustrative TEST DATA catalogue restoration

- [x] Create a distinct five-image, clearly labelled illustrative TEST DATA gallery for the physically verified Bonamoussadi demo listing. The gallery is explicitly marked illustrative and makes no claim that it is genuine, owner-authorized, or Field Moderator-captured.
- [x] Keep the illustrative test-media path isolated from real listing publication: it uses a separate table and explicit `illustrative_test_data` provenance. Both real and test listing discovery still requires a substantive description plus five displayed photos or a published walkthrough; real homes additionally require genuine approved media or an approved walkthrough at publication.
- [x] Validate that the restored demo catalogue visibly labels illustrative test media, retains privacy boundaries, restores the catalogue from two to three homes, and preserves existing publication-gate tests. Full validation passes with 234 tests, one intentional live-provider skip, production build, and desktop/mobile review.
- [ ] Complete the Makepe illustrative TEST DATA gallery with one additional distinct image once image generation is available again. The daily free-plan image quota is currently exhausted; Makepe has two approved evidence photos plus two labelled illustrative test images, so remains correctly hidden under the five-photo rule.

## Refreshed AHC presentation and in-depth SRS

- [x] Consolidate the current AHC product scope, user roles, workflows, trust safeguards, technical architecture, integrations, data model, test posture, and deployment boundaries from the implemented project.
- [x] Create a refreshed 11-slide PowerPoint presentation covering the product, marketplace advantage, media-first discovery, operational model, architecture, security, and next steps.
- [x] Produce an in-depth Word Software Requirements Specification with functional and non-functional requirements, data entities, role permissions, interfaces, workflows, acceptance criteria, risks, and release prerequisites.
- [x] Review both deliverables for accuracy and readability, then deliver the PowerPoint and Word document as downloadable files.

## BBoyo public profitability estimate

- [ ] Identify the relevant BBoyo housing marketplace entity and collect public evidence on its business model, pricing, scale, funding, traffic, and disclosures.
- [ ] Produce a clearly labelled, assumption-driven profitability range that distinguishes public facts from scenario inputs and explains material uncertainty.

## Context-aware visual discovery reinvention

- [x] Define an AHC-specific media-led browsing system inspired by the usability of the supplied reference without copying Airbnb branding, wording, rating conventions, or layout verbatim.
- [x] Create responsive horizontal property collections driven by current public listing context, including city/neighbourhood, affordability, household fit, and related-home signals. Sparse inventory displays one non-repetitive shelf; richer inventory unlocks further budget and household collections.
- [x] Rework listing cards so approved or clearly labelled illustrative TEST DATA media leads, Total Move-In Cash and rent remain immediately clear, and compact facts, verification freshness, provenance, and landmark-only privacy stay visible without visual overload.
- [x] Add accessible collection navigation, mobile scroll behavior, appropriate empty states, and no-content fallbacks; retain existing search, favourites, safety, and viewing-request functions.
- [x] Add focused tests and responsive review for the reinvented discovery experience. The focused shelf regression passes, the full suite passes with 236 tests and one intentional live-provider skip, the production build passes, and desktop/mobile reviews are complete.

## Real public-listing focused discovery

- [x] Remove the separate non-production/private-style public browsing treatment and replace remaining public “private viewing” wording with neutral viewing-request language. Landmark-only address protection and the authorised-viewing contact boundary remain unchanged.
- [x] Make the real eligible public-home collection the primary media-first visual experience, without a special TEST DATA/private presentation competing with actual property cards. The duplicate long-form discovery grid is retired; the compact budget-fit tool remains optional below the real home shelf.
- [x] Validate real-listing routing, favourites, viewing requests, map gating, provenance disclosures, desktop/mobile presentation, and source-contract coverage. The full suite passes with 237 tests, one intentional live-provider skip, and the production build passes.

## Catalogue-first public Find Homes page

- [x] Restructure the public marketplace so actual eligible house cards appear immediately beneath the header, rather than after the large marketing-style hero and route strip.
- [x] Replace the large hero/form with compact in-catalogue discovery controls and preserve AHC-specific Total Move-In Cash, approved-media provenance, verification freshness, and landmark-only privacy on real listing cards.
- [x] Validate desktop/mobile catalogue-first browsing, real-listing routing, safety gates, and no repeated/competing discovery layers before checkpointing. Full validation passes with 238 tests, one intentional live-provider skip, production build, and desktop/mobile review.
- [x] Present the unfiltered catalogue as a Douala and Yaoundé marketplace rather than deriving the opening shelf wording from the first returned city; do not modify database records.
- [x] Preserve existing compact search, city selection, move-in budget, advanced filters, and budget-fit behaviour while changing only the public discovery design and wording.

## Fuller labelled TEST DATA catalogue restoration

- [x] Audit the existing hidden TEST DATA listings and their public-gallery or illustrative-media readiness without changing real-listing eligibility rules.
- [x] Restore the fuller TEST DATA catalogue to public discovery only with clear TEST DATA and media-provenance labelling; retain the five-media quality rule for real homes.
- [x] Add regression coverage and validate desktop/mobile catalogue count, card routing, provenance labels, privacy safeguards, and retained search filters before checkpointing. The unfiltered public search now returns all 8 stored TEST DATA listings; full validation passes with 238 tests, one intentional live-provider skip, production build, and desktop/mobile review.

## Catalogue sorting, favourites, and quick preview

- [x] Add an accessible catalogue sort control for Total Move-In Cash low-to-high and newest-first while preserving all active search and filter criteria.
- [x] Add a card-level favourite action connected to the existing authenticated seeker favourites workflow, with clear signed-out guidance and no loss of the card’s detail action.
- [x] Add accessible hover and keyboard-focus card previews that reveal an amenity summary and a clear View Details action without hiding media provenance, privacy, or TEST DATA labels.
- [x] Add regression coverage and validate desktop/mobile sorting, favourites, detail routing, privacy, and provenance before checkpointing. Full validation passes with 239 tests, one intentional live-provider skip, production build, and desktop/mobile review.

## Visible TEST DATA listing realism audit

- [x] Audit every visible TEST DATA listing’s title, description, media, bedroom, bathroom, parking, amenity, area, and price fields for contradictions or implausible combinations.
- [x] Correct all identified TEST DATA listing facts and public-facing presentation so they are internally realistic, while retaining their illustrative-media and TEST DATA disclosures.
- [x] Add regression coverage and validate desktop/mobile cards and detail views so incorrect property facts cannot return before checkpointing. All 8 TEST DATA entries pass the new consistency audit; full validation passes with 240 tests, one intentional live-provider skip, production build, and desktop/mobile review.

## Dedicated new-tab property detail pages

- [x] Replace the cramped in-page listing-detail presentation with a dedicated property route that has its own responsive page layout and clear return navigation.
- [x] Open property-card detail actions in a new browser tab while retaining accessible keyboard behaviour and the existing safe detail action on every card.
- [x] Preserve property media, TEST DATA provenance, Trust Passport, sign-in boundary, landmark-map gate, favourites, related homes, and protected safe-viewing flow on the new page.
- [x] Add routing and privacy regressions and validate desktop/mobile dedicated property pages before checkpointing. Full validation passes with 241 tests, one intentional live-provider skip, production build, and desktop/mobile dedicated-route review.

## Original high-contrast catalogue visual refinement

- [x] Refine the public catalogue’s typography, palette, spacing, and visual hierarchy into a distinctly AHC design with clear, accessible contrast.
- [x] Improve property-card media framing, factual hierarchy, favourite controls, collection navigation, and filter/sort controls without copying the supplied reference’s branding or layout.
- [x] Preserve visible Total Move-In Cash, verification freshness, TEST DATA/media provenance, landmark-only privacy, responsive utility, and keyboard focus treatment through the visual redesign.
- [x] Validate desktop/mobile contrast, legibility, interaction reachability, and retained marketplace safeguards before checkpointing. Full validation passes with 242 tests, one intentional live-provider skip, production build, and desktop/mobile review.

## Application-wide AHC visual system

- [x] Audit public, account, agent, moderator, and admin page surfaces to identify shared style hooks and page-specific readability risks.
- [x] Apply the refined AHC font stack, high-contrast palette, navigation, controls, cards, forms, and feedback patterns as the default visual language across all application pages.
- [x] Preserve role clarity, protected-workspace usability, error states, data density, responsive layouts, keyboard focus, and reduced-motion support while unifying the presentation.
- [x] Add regression coverage and validate public, seeker, agent, moderator, and admin representative views across desktop and mobile before checkpointing. Full validation passes with 243 tests, one intentional live-provider skip, production build, and public/protected/fallback desktop/mobile review.

## Understated elevated experience

- [x] Refine shared AHC typography, color tokens, surface materials, spacing, and ornamental restraint to convey dignity and personal importance without literal royalty language or symbols.
- [x] Introduce subtle elevated interaction details across navigation, controls, cards, forms, dashboards, and feedback states while retaining task clarity and accessibility.
- [x] Preserve marketplace trust cues, TEST DATA disclosures, role workflows, map privacy, keyboard focus, reduced motion, and responsive performance through the visual evolution.
- [x] Add regression coverage and validate representative public and protected views across desktop and mobile before checkpointing. Updated shared-style contract coverage; 243 tests pass with one intentional live-provider skip, production build passes, and public/protected/fallback desktop/mobile views were reviewed.

## Dark-mode functional repair

- [x] Trace why the visible dark-mode control does not activate a coherent dark application theme across public and protected routes.
- [x] Repair the theme state, persisted preference, semantic tokens, and shared visual surfaces so dark mode is usable, readable, and consistent.
- [x] Add focused regression coverage and validate desktop/mobile dark mode across public, Agent, Admin, Field Moderator, and fallback screens before checkpointing. The persisted dark preference was rendered live on the public catalogue; focused route-level cascade coverage, 244 tests (one intentional live-provider skip), production build, and mobile reviews passed.

## Dark-mode footer correction

- [x] Identify the public footer selectors that remain hidden or lack contrast after dark mode is enabled.
- [x] Add durable dark-mode footer surfaces, text, links, and focus states that remain clear at desktop and mobile widths.
- [x] Add regression coverage, validate the rendered footer in dark mode, and checkpoint the correction. The shared footer now owns a night surface instead of inheriting the dark theme’s light `--ink` foreground token; 244 tests (one intentional live-provider skip), production build, and a full public layout review pass.

## Dark-mode interaction polish

- [x] Add a smooth, restrained, reduced-motion-safe visual transition when the user switches between light and dark themes.
- [x] Audit and update dropdown, select, popover, dialog, modal, and overlay surfaces so they remain correctly layered, readable, and keyboard-clear in dark mode.
- [x] Add interactive hover and focus treatments to the public footer’s brand accent and any footer links while retaining touch usability.
- [x] Add focused regression coverage and validate public and protected dark-mode interactions before checkpointing. Live dark mode confirmed a native select inherits `color-scheme: dark` with readable text; shared overlay and transition source contracts are covered, with 244 tests (one intentional provider skip) and a production build passing.

## Revised complete Software Requirements Specification

- [x] Audit the supplied SRS against the implemented AHC marketplace scope, current workflows, safeguards, integrations, and known launch boundaries.
- [x] Produce an accurate, complete revised Word SRS within the requested 16–22-page limit, without inventing product capabilities or user-generated content.
- [x] Visually review the generated document for page count, readable tables, structure, and professional formatting before delivery. The revised file renders as 20 pages; front matter, role workflows, architecture, interface/accessibility, quality, launch, and closing traceability pages were visually reviewed.

## Immediate cross-route login synchronization

- [x] Trace the session cookie, `auth.me` query cache, route shell, and sign-in completion flow to identify why the homepage retains an anonymous state until refresh.
- [x] Synchronize sign-in and sign-out state immediately across public and protected routes, preserving existing role boundaries and external OAuth/local-agent session protections.
- [x] Add regression coverage and validate seeker sign-in/sign-out propagation across the homepage and a second route without browser refresh before checkpointing. Local sign-in and registration now write the successful user projection into the shared `auth.me` cache before route-dependent invalidations; existing sign-out already sets this cache to `null` immediately. The focused contract test, full 246-test suite (one intentional live-provider skip), production build, and public/protected layout checks pass.

## Seeker sign-in window return behavior

- [x] Trace the public seeker sign-in launch path, close/back controls, and sign-out return behavior to identify every case that can leave duplicate windows or tabs.
- [x] Close a dedicated seeker sign-in window on cancellation, return, or sign-out when it was opened by the platform, while preserving safe same-tab fallback behavior.
- [x] Add regression coverage and verify the seeker window behavior does not duplicate tabs before checkpointing. Platform-opened property windows are explicitly marked in the URL; their brand, browse, detail, unavailable, and sign-out return paths close the dedicated window instead of navigating back. Normal direct `/property/:id` links retain same-tab `/homes` navigation. Focused route and source contracts, the full 248-test suite (one intentional provider skip), and a production build pass.

## Exact seeker second-tab close correction

- [x] Reproduce the actual sign-out and back route of the platform-opened seeker tab to identify why it still falls through to a homepage navigation.
- [x] Ensure all return and sign-out actions in the platform-opened seeker tab close that tab completely, never render duplicate homepage content, and retain safe behavior for direct same-tab links.
- [x] Add an exact-path regression and validate the corrected second-tab behavior before checkpointing. A platform-opened seeker tab now keeps a session marker and guarded history entry. Interface return, sign-out, and browser Back invoke its close request; if a browser blocks script-close, the tab is replaced with `about:blank` rather than navigating to duplicate marketplace content. Direct same-tab property links retain ordinary catalogue navigation. The exact sign-out and Back tests, full 249-test suite (one intentional provider skip), and production build pass.

## Ten-minute AHC presentation speaking guide

- [x] Analyze the supplied AHC Product and Technical Overview deck and map its slide sequence to a ten-minute delivery structure.
- [x] Prepare a concise slide-by-slide speaking guide, including clear placement for the Agent pricing and Field Moderator explanation. The guide allocates 9 minutes 20 seconds across the eleven slides, leaving a 40-second transition/question buffer.

## Verified purchaser reviews on Agent profiles

- [x] Define a confirmed-purchase eligibility record and review policy that keeps organic trust score separate, prevents self-review/duplicate reviews, and protects purchaser privacy. Eligibility is derived only from an Admin-confirmed completed viewing; reviews are non-rated, one per confirmed outcome, require moderation, and public projections never expose purchaser identity, private purchase notes, or moderation notes.
- [x] Add secure database, server, and authorization contracts for Admin-confirmed purchases, purchaser-only review creation, Agent profile review summaries, and moderation status. The additive migration introduces appointment-derived `confirmed_purchases` and one-review-per-outcome `agent_reviews`; protected server contracts enforce the seeker role, ownership, completed-appointment derivation, duplicate prevention, pending moderation, anonymous public projection, and Admin-only confirmation/moderation.
- [x] Build the verified purchaser review section on Agent profiles and an eligible purchaser review action, without fabricating reviews, ratings, or testimonials. Public property profiles show only approved anonymous written experiences and an explicit non-rating distinction; eligible seekers receive a private composer; the Admin portal provides separate confirmation and moderation queues. No review fixture, rating, or testimonial data was created.
- [x] Add focused authorization, privacy, and workflow tests; validate the profile experience before checkpointing. Added five secure router/schema contract tests plus frontend source coverage; the full suite passes with 258 tests and one intentional provider skip, the production build passes, and the public review panel was visually reviewed at desktop and mobile widths.

## Verified purchaser review SRS amendment

- [x] Add the implemented verified purchaser review functional requirements table and governed workflow section to the supplied AHC SRS Word document, preserving its existing structure and styling. The revised file now includes a new “7A • Verified Purchaser Reviews” section inserted between Seeker Experience and Agent Operations, with FR-REV01 to FR-REV17 plus a governed workflow table and explicit trust/privacy boundary language.
