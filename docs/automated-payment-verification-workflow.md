# AHC Automated Platform-Service Payment Verification Workflow

**Author:** Manus AI  
**Status:** Recommended design; no payment provider is connected yet  
**Scope:** AHC-owned service orders only. This workflow must never collect, route, hold, or release tenant rent, deposits, agency fees, or tenancy settlements.

## Purpose

AHC can reduce the Admin payment queue without trusting an Agent-entered Mobile Money reference. The safe model is that **AHC creates the payment request**, the external provider returns the result, and the AHC server independently confirms the final provider status before granting a commercial entitlement. This preserves the existing rule that a submitted reference alone has no value.

> **Verification principle:** A callback or browser return is a prompt to verify, not proof of payment. AHC grants an entitlement only after a server-to-server provider status check matches its own open service order.

The public MTN MoMo product overview describes merchant collection, invoices, payment-status capability, and business disbursements. [1] Kora’s Mobile Money guide documents the same control sequence: a unique merchant reference, wallet authorization, server-side status verification, and a payment webhook. [2] Notch Pay likewise documents a callback reference followed by a provider transaction-status query before a merchant updates its records. [3]

## Target service journey

| Stage | Customer experience | Automated server responsibility | Admin responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Select service | Agent selects Welcome, Starter, Pro, Featured, or a verification service in `/#/agent`. | Create one immutable AHC order with the service type, expected XAF amount, expiry, and a unique internal reference. | None. |
| 2. Start provider payment | Agent is redirected to hosted checkout or receives a secure wallet-prompt flow. | Create one provider payment intent using the AHC order reference as metadata; never expose a provider secret to the browser. | None. |
| 3. Authorize wallet | Agent authorizes with their own Mobile Money PIN or provider-hosted page. | Store only the provider payment identifier and masked payer detail when permitted; do not store wallet PINs, OTPs, or raw sensitive payment data. | None. |
| 4. Receive provider event | Agent sees a pending or success screen. | Authenticate the webhook; deduplicate it; query the provider status endpoint; compare reference, merchant account, currency, expected amount, and final status. | None for clean matches. |
| 5. Reconcile entitlement | Agent sees a confirmed receipt and their paid entitlement. | Atomically mark the order confirmed once and grant the exact entitlement once. | Review only exceptions. |
| 6. Exception handling | Agent sees a clear pending/review or failed message. | Move mismatched, duplicated, expired, incomplete, or unverifiable payment events to an Admin exception queue. | Resolve or reject with a recorded reason. |

## Automatic-confirmation rule

AHC should automatically reconcile an order only when **all** of the following are true:

| Required control | Reason |
|---|---|
| The provider webhook signature or equivalent authenticity mechanism is valid. | Stops unauthenticated callers from imitating provider events. |
| The provider payment identifier has not already been processed. | Makes repeated webhook delivery safe and prevents duplicate credit grants. |
| The provider-side lookup reports a final successful status. | A browser redirect, “processing” state, or user-provided screenshot is not sufficient. |
| The provider reference maps to one open AHC order. | Stops a paid reference from being attached to a different service. |
| The amount equals the server-calculated order amount in XAF. | Prevents underpayment and price substitution. |
| The currency, merchant account, and payment environment match the AHC configuration. | Stops sandbox events, wrong-currency transfers, and payments to an unrelated merchant account. |
| The order has not expired, been cancelled, refunded, or already been reconciled. | Prevents replay and post-expiry entitlement grants. |

If any check fails, AHC must **not** partially grant the offer. It creates an immutable exception record, preserves the provider payload only as necessary for audit, and lets an Admin decide the outcome.

## Resulting order states

| Status | Meaning | Who can move it |
|---|---|---|
| `awaiting_payment` | AHC order was created but no provider result is final. | System or expiry job. |
| `provider_processing` | Wallet prompt or hosted payment is underway. | Provider event or safe requery. |
| `confirmed_automatically` | All matching checks succeeded and entitlement was granted once. | System only. |
| `needs_admin_review` | A safety check failed or a provider response could not be verified. | System creates it; Admin resolves it. |
| `rejected` | Admin rejected it with a reason. | Admin only. |
| `expired` | Payment was not completed within the stated window. | System. |
| `refunded` | Approved provider refund was confirmed. | Admin-approved system process. |

## Entitlement boundary after confirmation

The server uses the already-approved commercial rules; payment automation does not bypass them.

| Confirmed AHC order | Server action |
|---|---|
| Welcome Bundle | Mark the one-time Welcome entitlement used, activate 30 days of normal-priority access, and issue five listing credits. |
| Starter | Activate 30 days of normal-priority access and issue five listing credits. |
| Pro | Activate 30 days of priority access; enforce the 20 active-listing limit at listing creation. |
| Featured | Apply exactly seven days of featured placement to the chosen eligible listing. |
| Route-batch verification | Create one pending route-batch verification request for one property; no badge is granted until the Field Moderator passes the visit and review rules are met. |
| Individual verification | Create one pending individual verification request for one property under the same evidence and review standard. |

The confirmation event must be committed with an idempotency key in a single database transaction. A repeated webhook, retry, or staff page refresh must return the existing result and never issue a second credit, second plan period, or second verification request.

## Fraud and human-review queue

The automation should deliberately stop at the following boundaries instead of guessing.

| Trigger | Automatic system response | Admin decision |
|---|---|---|
| Amount, currency, merchant, or internal reference mismatch | Freeze in `needs_admin_review`; grant nothing. | Reject, correct a configuration issue, or handle verified over/underpayment under policy. |
| Same provider reference linked to two orders | Lock both affected records and log the collision. | Decide the valid order and reject the duplicate claim. |
| Webhook arrives but provider lookup remains pending | Retry safely on a short back-off schedule, then expire or queue for review. | Review only if the provider status remains unresolved. |
| Provider reports failure, cancellation, or reversal | Mark failed/reversed; remove no previously granted entitlement without an audited refund/reversal process. | Investigate if an entitlement was already used. |
| Repeated suspicious attempts from one account | Rate-limit new payment intents and flag the account. | Suspend or restore account access based on evidence. |
| Refund request | Keep entitlement and payout consequences visible; do not automate a refund solely from the request. | Approve a documented provider refund and apply the matching entitlement policy. |

## Privacy and security controls

Payment-provider secrets belong only in server-side environment settings. The browser receives a checkout URL, a short-lived payment session, or a provider prompt instruction—not API credentials. AHC should log webhook event identifiers, order identifiers, status transitions, actor, and timestamp; it should mask payer wallet numbers in operational screens and restrict raw provider payload access to Admins with a genuine reconciliation need.

The webhook endpoint should enforce signature validation, a small request body limit, strict content type, IP or provider-origin controls if the provider supports them, duplicate-event storage, and rapid acknowledgement after durable event capture. Provider status verification should occur from the server rather than the browser. AHC should also retain manual reconciliation as a fallback during provider downtime and use a visible “payment is still being verified” state rather than promising immediate access.

## Moderator payment remains separate

The incoming service payment can be reconciled automatically. However, **Field Moderator payouts should not become automatic merely because an Agent paid AHC**. The existing hold remains correct: the system records the expected 80% share only after a service order is confirmed; the Admin releases or records the payout only after required property evidence, any second-verifier audit, and approval. Any future provider disbursement integration should be a separate, Admin-approved payout workflow with its own provider verification and audit trail.

## Recommended phased rollout

| Phase | Delivery | Admin-work reduction | Risk control |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0. Improve current manual process | Create unique AHC order codes and require them in payment narration; preserve Admin reconciliation. | Low to moderate. | No automatic entitlement. |
| 1. Hosted checkout | Integrate one Cameroon-capable, properly contracted provider checkout with return URL, signed webhook, and provider status lookup. | High for ordinary successful payments. | Auto-confirm only clean exact matches; exceptions remain with Admin. |
| 2. Wallet-native prompts | Add direct Mobile Money request-to-pay where the provider supports AHC’s merchant account and required compliance. | Higher conversion and lower Agent entry error. | Same server-side verification rule. |
| 3. Approved payout integration | Consider controlled Moderator payout initiation after Admin approval. | Reduces payout administration. | Never auto-payout solely on payment confirmation; require separate approval and payout-status verification. |

## Decision needed before implementation

AHC should select **one provider for the first release** after confirming merchant eligibility, Cameroon coverage, XAF support, settlement terms, KYC requirements, fees, webhook signing, refund support, and the availability of a production account. A hosted checkout is the lowest-risk first integration because it avoids handling wallet authentication in the AHC interface. MTN MoMo is a strategic direct option if AHC can obtain the appropriate merchant API access; a Cameroon-oriented aggregator may reduce initial integration work, but its exact support and commercial terms must be confirmed directly with that provider before committing.

Once a provider is chosen, the next implementation work is to add provider-payment fields and an immutable event ledger, create the server-only checkout and webhook procedures, introduce `needs_admin_review` as a protected Admin queue, add idempotency and webhook tests, and then use the provider sandbox before enabling live payments.

## Recommended first route: hosted checkout with Kora

AHC should start with **Kora Checkout for Cameroon XAF**, subject to successful merchant onboarding and written confirmation of current terms. Kora publicly states that its Cameroon capability can accept both MTN MoMo and Orange Money in XAF through Checkout or API, and that the feature is enabled after its onboarding and compliance process. [4] This is a stronger first release choice than integrating direct MTN MoMo alone because it gives Agents access to the two local wallet rails through one initial checkout integration, while the provider handles the wallet-facing authorization experience.

| Decision criterion | Kora Checkout first | Direct MTN MoMo first |
|---|---|---|
| Agent wallet coverage | One integration can cover stated MTN MoMo and Orange Money Cameroon XAF flows. | Covers MTN wallet users; Orange Money requires a separate integration. |
| Initial engineering | Hosted payment page, callback, webhook verification, and one provider client. | Merchant collection integration, direct wallet flows, and a later second rail to reach Orange users. |
| Sensitive payment interface | Provider-hosted; AHC does not collect wallet PINs or OTPs. | AHC must handle more of the wallet-flow orchestration while still keeping secrets server-side. |
| Launch risk | Still requires merchant KYC and commercial confirmation, but has a clearer two-wallet launch path. | Direct provider relationship may be strategically valuable but is a narrower initial acceptance path. |
| Long-term option | Keep a provider adapter so direct MTN/Orange integrations can replace or supplement Checkout later. | More provider-specific work before broad local wallet coverage. |

The recommendation is not a guarantee about availability, fees, settlement timing, or onboarding approval. AHC should obtain Kora’s current Cameroon merchant agreement and test credentials before coding against production. If Kora cannot onboard AHC on acceptable terms, the fallback is direct MTN MoMo collection as the first rail, while retaining the same provider-adapter and automated-verification design for a later Orange Money addition.

### Implementation gates

| Gate | Required evidence before the next gate |
|---|---|
| Merchant readiness | Registered merchant details, settlement destination, compliance documents, and explicit confirmation that Cameroon XAF MTN MoMo and Orange Money Checkout are enabled. |
| Commercial acceptance | Written confirmation of per-transaction fees, settlement schedule, refund process, supported payment limits, and the account owner responsible for provider disputes. |
| Technical sandbox | Test API keys, signed-webhook specification, payment-status lookup, and successful tests for success, cancellation, expiry, duplicate callback, and wrong-amount events. |
| Controlled release | Start with one low-risk AHC service such as Featured placement; retain the manual Admin route as fallback. |
| Broad release | Confirm clean reconciliation, support process, and exception queue behaviour before enabling plans and verification orders. |
